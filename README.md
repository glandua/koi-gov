## ðŸŒ± Overview

Welcome to the **KOI (Knowledge Organization Infrastructure) Governance Repository**. This space holds the canonical semantic naming conventions and governance documents stewarded by Regen Network Development, PBC.

KOI is our collective infrastructure for creating coherent, transparent, and actionable knowledge objects within Regen Network. By maintaining semantic clarity, we enable decentralized teams, AI agents, and community participants to collaborate meaningfully.

## ðŸ“– Semantic Naming Quick Reference

### Naming Structure
```
[relevance].[type].[subject].vX.Y.Z
```

### Relevance Levels
- **`core`**: Fundamental, actively used, essential to strategic decisions.
- **`relevant`**: Informative, actively cited, influential in ongoing work.
- **`background`**: Contextual, supportive, historical, or ambient reference.

### Object Types
- **`memo`**: Structured strategic or operational documents.
- **`analysis`**: Data-driven or qualitative deep dives.
- **`notes`**: Informal or exploratory ideas and documentation.
- **`decision`** *(proposed)*: Official organizational decisions.
- **`readme`**: Canonical documentation for directories or patterns.

### Semantic Versioning
- `vX.0.0`: Major conceptual shifts
- `vX.Y.0`: Minor, meaningful content updates
- `vX.Y.Z`: Editorial, non-conceptual adjustments or clarifications

## ðŸŒ¿ Why KOI Matters

Implementing clear, semantic naming isn't trivialâ€”it's foundational. It:

- **Facilitates trust and clarity** within distributed teams and collaborators.
- **Supports adaptive governance** and decision-making.
- **Empowers human-AI collaboration** through semantic precision.

Let's tend our shared garden of knowledge and coherence together.
