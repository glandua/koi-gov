## ðŸŒ± Overview

Welcome to the **KOI (Knowledge Organization Infrastructure) Governance Repository**. This space holds the canonical semantic naming conventions and governance documents stewarded by Regen Network Development, PBC.

KOI is our collective infrastructure for creating coherent, transparent, and actionable knowledge objects within Regen Network. By maintaining semantic clarity, we enable decentralized teams, AI agents, and community participants to collaborate meaningfully.

> ðŸ’¡ **New to KOI or GitHub?**  
> This repo is for everyone â€” not just coders! If youâ€™re a scientist, community builder, designer, or strategist, KOI helps you contribute documents that are clear, consistent, and findable. Start with our [Semantic Naming via Properties guide](./docs/semantic-naming-properties.md).

## ðŸ“– Semantic Naming Quick Reference

### Naming Structure
```
[relevance].[type].[subject].vX.Y.Z
```

### Relevance Levels
- **`core`**: Foundational, widely used, and trusted.
- **`relevant`**: Actively cited, helpful in ongoing work.
- **`background`**: Informative, ambient, or historical.

### Object Types
- **`memo`**: Strategic or operational documents.
- **`analysis`**: Data-driven or qualitative breakdowns.
- **`notes`**: Informal, exploratory documentation.
- **`decision`**: Records of formal decisions.
- **`readme`**: Descriptive documentation of a folder or pattern.

### Semantic Versioning
- `vX.0.0`: Major conceptual shifts
- `vX.Y.0`: New content or moderate updates
- `vX.Y.Z`: Minor or editorial changes

## ðŸ§  Property-Based Naming Format (New)

When using modern tools like Notion, you can separate the KOI title and metadata:

- **Human-friendly title**: e.g. `"Q2 Strategy â€“ Commons Activation"`
- **Properties**:
  - KOI Name: `core.objective.q2-commons-activation.v2025-Q2.v1.0.0`
  - Type, Version, Relevance, Status (stored in tool-native fields)

âž¡ See: [`semantic-naming-properties.md`](./docs/semantic-naming-properties.md) for examples in Notion, GDocs, and GitHub

## ðŸŒ¿ Why KOI Matters

Implementing clear, semantic naming isn't trivialâ€”it's foundational. It:

- Facilitates trust and clarity across distributed teams
- Enables decentralized governance and documentation
- Supports AI and agent-based coordination with structured knowledge

Letâ€™s tend our shared garden of meaning, one clear name at a time. ðŸŒ±
