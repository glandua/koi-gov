# Contributing to KOI Governance

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Knowledge Organization Infrastructure (KOI)**! This document outlines how you can meaningfully contribute to KOI governance, naming conventions, and semantic standards.

---

## üëê How to Contribute

We warmly invite all community members, non-technical participants, and Regen Network stakeholders to contribute through the following methods:

1. **Propose changes** via GitHub Pull Requests (PRs).
2. **Join weekly governance calls** to discuss, review, and refine proposals.
3. **Participate in piloting and testing** new naming conventions internally before official adoption.

---

## üìå Proposing Changes

To propose a new KOI prefix, type, relevance tier, or naming convention:

1. **Create a clearly named proposal document** using the current KOI naming standard:
    ```
    meta.reflection.koi-[proposed-change-name].v0.1.0.md
    ```

2. **Clearly articulate your proposal** within the document, including:
    - The specific prefix, type, or tier proposed.
    - Semantic gaps or ambiguities it resolves.
    - Examples demonstrating how the new proposal would be used.
    - Any anticipated tradeoffs (e.g., complexity, readability, tooling impact).

3. **Submit your proposal as a Pull Request (PR)** to this repository.
    - Clearly summarize your changes and reasoning in the PR description.
    - Indicate whether your change is major, minor, or patch according to semantic versioning guidelines.

## üöß Piloting & Testing Proposals

Before official adoption, each new KOI naming convention proposal should undergo a short piloting phase:

- **Internal Piloting:**
    - Use your proposed naming convention in a limited, clearly defined set of internal documents.
    - Gather feedback on clarity, usability, and semantic coherence.

- **Document Results:**
    - Update your PR or proposal document with pilot findings.
    - Clearly indicate whether the pilot supported adopting the proposal as-is or if modifications are needed.

## üìÜ Governance & Review Process

All proposals are reviewed and ratified through our weekly governance meetings, held jointly by Regen Network Development and Regen Foundation teams:

- **Weekly Governance Calls:**
    - Time-boxed, efficient review and discussion.
    - Opportunity to present, discuss, and refine proposals in real-time.

- **Decision-making:**
    - Consensus-driven, with clear documentation of any objections or amendments.

- **Ratification & Merge:**
    - Approved proposals are merged into the repository, with explicit semantic version updates.
    - Changes and rationales are logged in the [`changelog.md`](./changelog.md).

---

## üìñ Semantic Versioning Discipline

Clearly communicate the impact of your proposal using semantic versioning in your PR:

- `vX.0.0`: Major conceptual shifts (introducing entirely new prefixes, tiers, or fundamental restructuring)
- `vX.Y.0`: Meaningful updates or expansions of existing conventions
- `vX.Y.Z`: Editorial, non-conceptual clarifications, or minor refinements

Include clear explanations of your semantic versioning choices in your PR description.

---

## ‚ùì Issues & Community Feedback

- Open an **Issue** on GitHub to:
    - Suggest ideas without submitting a formal proposal.
    - Provide general feedback, ask questions, or clarify existing naming conventions.

- Issues will be reviewed and addressed during weekly governance calls.

---

## üôå Getting Support

For assistance, questions, or guidance, please:

- Reach out directly to Gregory Landua or designated maintainers.
- Attend the weekly governance calls.
- Open an issue clearly labeled as `question` or `support`.
